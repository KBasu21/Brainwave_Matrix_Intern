This repository contains the tasks completed during my internship at Brainwave Matrix Solutions as a Python Programming Intern.

# Task 1: ATM Interface
The first task is to develop a fully functional ATM interface using Python. The features include:

Deposit: Allows the user to deposit money and update the balance.
Withdrawal: Enables the user to withdraw money, with the balance updating accordingly.
Balance Check: Displays the current account balance.
Exit: Closes the interface.

The ATM system ensures real-time balance updates for both deposits and withdrawals, providing a user-friendly experience.
